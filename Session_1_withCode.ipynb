    "The basic idea behind this course is that we can tell a lot about the meaning of a given word by looking at the words that are used \"near\" it. In our case, this will mean looking at digital copies of texts, treating them as sequences of words, and observing which words tend to appear within a few positions of each other in those sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion that meaning relies heavily upon context has a long, rich history in linguistics, philosophy of language, natural language processing, and other fields. One important early thinker in this domain (and we'll cast a pretty broad net in describing the domain here) is Ferdinand de Saussure, who argues that words should not be understood as a bunch of names for objects. Rather, they are signs (and often pretty arbitrary signs), and their meaning is determined not by pointing at objects, but by the internal relationships of the broader system in which they exist.[$^{1}$](#1) \n",
    "\n",
    "We find a similar argument at the beginning of Ludwig Wittgenstein's _Philosophical Investigations_, published about a half century after Saussure's work. Wittgenstein begins with a quote from Augustine of Hippo, suggesting that language is learned by pointing at objects and saying their names (an \"ostensive\" model). Wittgenstein point out that a lot of language doesn't seem to function that way (think of someone yelling \"Help!\"), and argues that the Augustinian model is flawed. His ideas (in this period at least) are often summarized with his claim that \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language\".[$^{2}$](#2)  This \"use\" can be quite complex, and involves components that go beyond the presence of other words—for instance, when you yell \"Help!\", the meaning will depend on factors like whether you are flailing in a swimming pool vs. about to drop a stack of plates, your relationships to the people around you, and so on. Still, in a broad sense it does seem like \"use\" must incorporate at least some information about how a word tends to be deployed relative to other words—or in any case, many people have understood Wittgenstein that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention Saussure and Wittgenstein because of their importance in thinking about language as a non-ostensive system in which meaning seems to have something to do with the entire system of the language. But the most relevant context for our work in this course is probably the distributional hypothesis, which has its home more in linguistics. As you might remember from the course description, the linguist J.R. Firth famously said, \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\". This basic idea arguably sits at the foundation of quite a lot of modern work in linguistics and natural language processing.[$^{3}$](#3) For instance, word vector models generally depend on counting how frequently words appear near each other in a large corpus of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the work of this course, because most distributional models (or contextual theories of language meaning in general) at some point involve _collocates_. \"Collocate\" is a term of art for any word that appears near some target word (if you think of the name as co-locate, you've basically got its meaning). For example, if we looked at a large collection of 1960's and 70's movie reviews, we would probably find that the collocates of \"Connery\" would include words like \"Sean\", \"Bond\", \"007\", and so on—depending on how we measured them, they might even includes things like \"spy\" or \"martini\". \n",
    "\n",
    "With enough of these collocates, would we begin to understand what \"Connery\" _means_ in the context of Cold War cinema? Maybe! By learning to find collocates, we will set ourselves up to think more deeply about questions like these, which remain lively areas of investigation in several disciplines. And we will also make it easier to examine what's going on with specific words or texts (e.g., if you wanted to know how the Supreme Court has discussed \"privacy\" over time, you could use collocates in your investigation). \n",

    "\n",
    "When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights ‘gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\n",
    "\n",
    "Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?\n",
    "\n",
    "But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God- so better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing- straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!"
